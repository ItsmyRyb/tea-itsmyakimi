Getting Started

To use this smart contract, you will need a few things:

    A text editor or IDE familiar with Solidity
    A local development environment configured for Solidity development (e.g., Truffle, Hardhat)
    A funded Ethereum wallet containing some ERC20 tokens

Deployment:

    Clone this repository to your local machine.
    Install the required dependencies (refer to the package.json file for details).
    Deploy the contract to a test network (e.g., Rinkeby) using your development environment.
    Interact with the contract using a web3 interface or your development environment's console.

Functionality:

This smart contract provides the following basic functionality:

    Transfer ERC20 tokens from one address to another

Security Considerations:

While this is a basic transfer contract, it's crucial to understand ERC20 token vulnerabilities before deploying it in a production environment. Common considerations include:

    Reentrancy attacks: Transactions can be exploited if they call external functions before updating the contract's state.
    Allowance issues: Users might unintentionally grant unlimited spending approval to another address.
